Error: File ./myproject.db doesn't exist.
Usage:
cqsearch [-s <sqdbfile> [-p <n>] [-g] [-t <term>] [-l <len>] -[e|f] [-u] [-b <path>]]  [-d] [-v] [-h] [-k <depth>]

options:
  -s : CodeQuery sqlite3 db file path
  -p : parameter is a number denoted by n
       default n = 1 (Symbol)
  -g : Create GraphViz DOT output instead of search results
       Applicable only for function or macro def(n=2) and
       class or struct (n=3)
  -t : search term without spaces
       if Exact Match is switched off, wild card
       searches are possible. Use * and ?
  -l : limited line length for truncated source code preview text
       Accepted range: 0 - 800 (use 0 for limitless)
       By default it is 80
  -e : Exact Match switched ON 
       Case-sensitive
  -f : Exact Match switched OFF (fuzzy search)
       Case-insensitive with wild card search (default)
  -u : show full file path instead of file name
  -b : filters the results by source file path term
       For example, if the path term is "test" (without quotes),
       then the results will be filtered by source files whose
       path includes the term "test"
  -d : debug
  -v : version
  -h : help

  -k : recursively create callee graph up to specified depth(<5)

The combinations possible are -s -t -e, -s -t -f -u
The additional optional arguments are -d

The possible values for n are:
    1: Symbol (default)
    2: Function or macro definition
    3: Class or struct
    4: Files including this file
    5: Full file path
    6: Functions calling this function
    7: Functions called by this function
    8: Calls of this function or macro
    9: Members and methods of this class
   10: Class which owns this member or method
   11: Children of this class (inheritance)
   12: Parent of this class (inheritance)
   13: Functions or macros inside this file

Example:
cqsearch -s myproject.db -p 6 -t read*file -f

Example of using -g with GraphViz:
cqsearch -s myproject.db -p 2 -g -t read*file > functioncallgraph.dot
dot -Tpng -ofunctioncallgraph.png functioncallgraph.dot
